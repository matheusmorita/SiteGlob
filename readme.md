# Introduction

First of all, the website follows the MVC pattern of software architecture. Therefore, some technologies are used for compilation and rendering such as **Webpack ^5.7**, **Express ^4.17** and so on. All of them are supported by **Node.js**.

# IDE settings

For easier viewing and simplifying the working environment, some settings have been applied to the VSCode IDE. All of them can be viewed at: 
**.vscode > settings.json**

# Getting started

Once you have access to the repository, clone it into your local repositories folder using:

> git clone https://github.com/Blocklize/SiteGlob/

Once cloned, select the correct branch:

> git checkout main
> *git checkout -b new_branch*

As previously stated, the website architecture has some dependencies, to install them:

> npm install

Finally, some scripts are pre-configured for both environments (production and development). Both can be started locally via the respective commands:

> npm run dev
> npm run build
